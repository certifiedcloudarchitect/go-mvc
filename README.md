### Components
#### Model
The model is the application's data structure used to provide consistency for the logic layer while utilizing various datasets.
#### View
The view is commonly referred to as the user interface and is usually composed of GUI components such as drop down boxes, text boxes/areas, radio button, charts/graphs, etc.
#### Controller
The controller is the set of code that contains the logic layer of the application. Common utilities are algorithms that utilize libraries for various functions.
